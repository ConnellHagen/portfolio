                <p>Hello, my name is Connell Hagen. I am currently a senior at Rosemount High School. I started taking computer science as a junior last year and I loved it. Next year, I will be studying computer science at the University Of Minnesota Twin Cities School of Science and Engineering. Before I took computer science, math has always been my favorite school subject, and so my liking for it comes from an ability to apply my math skills in practical ways. Outside of coding I have many hobbies. I am a members of my school's math team, I'm a captain on our quiz bowl team, and I am a member of our top jazz band as a trumpet player. Music is a large passion of mine and I spend many hours a day listening to it - my favorite genres are Hip Hop, Jazz and Soul. One day, my dream would be to be able to use my knowledge of computer science and music together, by either making a game, or by selling music online by myself. I work occasionally as a swimming lessons instructor for children with the school district. I don't swim often or competitively, but I do enjoy it and love to show others how.</p>
