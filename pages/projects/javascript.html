                    <p>Remaking the board game chess was the first project I did that was actually large. It took a lot of time to be able to figure how to represent the board and pieces in a way that the computer could use. Then to be able to convert the rules of the game into mathematical instructions for the computer was very difficult, since things that humans just consider common sense need to be implemented. This project greatly improved my ability to conceptualize and abstract, as there were always a lot of different objects interacting with one another in all aspects of the code.</p>

                    <p>For my Linear Algebra final for Fall 2021 we had a bit of a choice project, and so I wanted to use coding as a way to solve matrix operations. The very basic framework of laying out matrices was quite easy using 2D arrays, but complex operations like row reduction and finding the determinant were quite tricky. Creating the display and hooking it up to interact with the backend was also very tricky and my first time using js in an html website. In addition, some files would randomly stop working, and the whole program breaks when you remove a call for a nonexistent script so its definitely was a frustrating learning experience.</p>

                    <p>This was a school project where we were required to make a game. I wanted to remake Snake since it is simple and abstract, yet somewhat complicated to figure out an efficient way to program it. It was also an experiment with creating games that have more to them than just bare bones frameworks. I am still working on making this more unique and interesting in that manner. This also used the Button Class that I wrote for the Matrix Operation Calculator.</p>

                    <p>This project was assigned as a practice for taking data and displaying it however we like. The data in particular to display here was time data, so we made "abstract clocks". For my clock, I wanted there to be very simple bars that move across the screen as time passes. I had trouble trying to make the seconds bar move slowly however, since p5js's time API only allows accuracy to the second, and the milliseconds function is not very useful for the purposes I needed it for. I also used this project to practice stretching a p5js canvas to the screen size, and adjusting it as the window size is adjusted.</p>

                    <p>For this project, we were required to do something involving dice. Considering that I wanted to try to make roulette last year but didn't get the time to, I thought it would be fun to make a betting game. This project actually went extremely smoothly, especially at the beginning when I laid out lots of abstract work to make the rest simple. Laying out GUI, designing all of the visuals and making the dice were all things that helped me improve on my visual designing skills. The values for returns in this game are very broken however and if you know the strategy can easily be exploited to make lots of money quickly. This also was my first time making a Button Class and would contain the main ideas for my go-to p5.js Button Class I would later code.</p>

                    <p>This was our last project of the first trimester of Advanced Computer Science, and it was also our first group project. We had been working with the p5.js javascript library for a long time already, so the most notable takeaway from this project was the ability to compartmentalize code into seperate sections, and to work together in a group. We also did a couple new-er things in the code for practice, like using lambda functions and using cosine (for making the snow fall).</p>
