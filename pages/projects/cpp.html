                    <p>Being my first project in C++, this project came with many frustrations. Notably, the increased difficulty in setting up a compiler, and reading error messages to figure out what is wrong. Another difficult part was figuring out how to use hpp header files, and learning what items need to be `#include`d. Creating the game itself, it took many tries to figure out a working game loop that did not infinitely repeat. Lastly, there was some trouble with learning how data works compared to java. For example, converting between int and char often left me confused why there were emoji characters being saved in variables (now I see that c++ was reading an int 1 as '1' in the ascii character list, for example). This was a good leaning experience with how c++ works, but I am planning on using a graphics library in the future to be able to make more useful applications.</p>
