                    <p>I was inspired to make this by a similar project that my friend Ryan did earlier this year. The basic idea is that it takes in a text, and then uses that text as a template to generate faux-english words. The original version of this project used the concept of a markov chain, and probabilities of a letter being followed by another in order to generate words. The second version did the same, but did it in reverse order so that way words ended on letters that made more sense for pronunciation. The third (and current) version seperates the text into syllables, and pieces together those syllables randomly, so that way the words sound much more familiar and viable in english.</p>

                    <p>This program was built using the Processing library for java. A big challenge with it was keeping straight the syntax, since some parts are the same as Java and p5.js, and others are brand new. This is notable with the method of scanning in files in which using Java Scanner, which I was used to using, would not even work. The syntax for doing things like drawing rectangles and text is also a bit different than p5.js', so I had to read the documentation to get it to work properly. Lastly, I also casted char and int back and forth according to the ASCII values in order to do many of the functions within. I have never does this before, but it was much easier than making a 26 case switch statement.</p>

                    <p>These are some simple practice problem-style classes written for practice in java. Works like these were a majority of the work that I completed in my AP Computer Science A course in 2020-2021, and here are a few that I've completed in the following year. The current classes contained in this repository include: ScannerChopper, RegularPolygon and PermutationList. ScannerChopper was practice for using Java's Scanner class to chop up Strings. RegularPolygon and PermutationList challenged me to be able to take more abstract math concepts and write them in simple steps in code.</p>
